Note: IOS will ONLY work on macOS computers. I am sorry.

# Running

I tried to make this plugin as plug-n-play as possible!
Android's run configuration should be in place already.

Desktop, web, and iOS are a bit special.

### For Desktop:

Either run `MainKt` or find the `main.kt` file and press run on the gutter!

### For Web:

Either run `Run Web` or run `./gradlew :jsApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun`

### For iOS:

Open the `iosApp` in XCode via `iosApp.xcworkspace` and run as normal from there.

# Installing
